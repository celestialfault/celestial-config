A utility library on top of GSON for use with configuration files; this abstracts the loading and
saving of JSON files for you, so all you need to worry about is what variables you need to save,
and in what manner.

## Usage

Add this as a dependency in your build configuration from [my Maven repository](https://maven.odinair.xyz/);
an example usage of the library is available in the [`example`](example) directory.
