[![celestial-config badge](https://maven.celestialfault.dev/api/badge/latest/snapshots/dev/celestialfault/celestial-config?color=40c14a&name=celestial-config&prefix=v)](https://maven.celestialfault.dev/)

A Kotlin library designed to make using GSON slightly more convenient, so all you need to worry about is what
data you need stored, instead of having to write the same standard boilerplate every time.

Note that while you may be able to use this in pure Java (with a substantial amount of effort), this is not tested
nor supported in any capacity.

## Usage

Add this as a dependency in your build configuration from [my Maven repository](https://maven.celestialfault.dev/).
