This is a JVM Kotlin library acting as a wrapper around GSON, intending to make using it much less cumbersome when all
you want is a simple JSON file storing values.

## Usage

Add this as a dependency in your build configuration from [my Maven repository](https://maven.celestialfault.dev/).

An example usage of this library is provided in the [example.kt test](src/test/kotlin/example.kt).
